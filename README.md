# THIS IS THE 2015 ROBOT CODE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH
#

In order to connect to the RoboRio, to push source 
up. First install the FRC Update suite, located at:
http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2015/5112/en/

This is needed because the RoboRio uses mDns to connect. 
By default Windows does not include an install. The FRC Update
Suite includes an implementation of the mDns protcol handler.


Also follow these instrutions to install Eclipse and get the necessary
plugins and libraries:
